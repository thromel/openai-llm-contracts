# Complete LLM API Contract Coverage Plan

## Executive Summary

The current research paper covers approximately **70%** of LLM API contract types comprehensively, with strong coverage of core areas but gaps in system-level and operational contracts. This document outlines a plan to achieve **100% contract type coverage**.

## Current Coverage Assessment

### ✅ **Well Covered (70%)**
1. **Input Contracts**: Data types, value constraints, structured formats
2. **Output Contracts**: Format validation, content policy enforcement  
3. **Temporal Contracts**: Call ordering, initialization sequences
4. **Basic Integration**: LangChain, agent frameworks

### ⚠️ **Partially Covered (20%)**
5. **Performance**: Mentioned but not systematically categorized
6. **Security**: Content policy only, missing broader security concerns
7. **State Management**: Basic conversation handling only

### ❌ **Missing Coverage (10%)**
8. **Financial/Cost**: Usage limits, budget controls, billing transparency
9. **Reliability/SLA**: Availability, error handling, circuit breaking
10. **Advanced Integration**: Multimodal, ecosystem evolution

## Comprehensive Contract Taxonomy

### Tier 1: Core API Contracts (Current Focus)

## Technical Implementation

### Extended Architecture
```python
# Comprehensive contract enforcement stack
class LLMContractStack:
    def __init__(self):
        self.layers = {
            'input_validation': InputContractLayer(),
            'security': SecurityContractLayer(),
            'performance': PerformanceContractLayer(),
            'financial': FinancialContractLayer(),
            'reliability': ReliabilityContractLayer(),
            'output_validation': OutputContractLayer(),
            'state_management': StateContractLayer()
        }
```
